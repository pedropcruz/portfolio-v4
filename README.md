Hello world! Another site developed by me, and as you could already tell from the name of the repository, it's a new portfolio that I make.

I like to update it. In my opinion, it is where you should expose all your work that you develop in your career as a developer, and of course communicate better with the world as well!

This portfolio is developed in Nuxt3, I love the Vue world, and I still have a lot to learn!

If you see something here that you think could be improved, feel free to open a PR and suggest a change ;)

With this portfolio, I intend to add:

- Work I'm developing over time, and explain the whole process
- Opinion articles about various topics in the development world, from how to feel as a developer, to new technologies, and maybe tutorials
- Add multilingual support, I intend to expand more in my country (Portugal) as a developer and inspire people to be programmers and change their lives.
- Learn a lot and constantly more about technology
- Adding comments to my articles, and sharing opinions with visitors
- Easy access to my CV

For now these are the points I want to add, but you can always suggest, open a PR and we'll discuss about the topic!

Thanks <3
